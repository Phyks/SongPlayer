Chorizo.py :
====

This script allows you to play music using a chorizo (or whatever food you
like) keyboard ! See README for more info and links.

As all the other scripts in this repository, I release it under a very
permissive license. To make a long story short : do whatever you want with
this script (but try to have fun :), I don't mind. It would be cool to quote
the origin of the script if you reuse it, but you don't have to. I'd like to
be noticed of what you did cool with it (if you think it's worth). :)
Ah, I almost forgot : If by chance we ever meet and you think this script is
worth, you can buy me a soda :)
